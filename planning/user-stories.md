### *Backstory/Inspiration*

Kevin and his five good mates; James, Sally, Claire, Michael and Jonnathan are out for a casual catch-up at a local bar. 

As is common when this group gets together, discussion soon turns to comparing their 'favourites' or 'tops' in a number of different categores, 
with each one believe they have the ultimate knowledge and ranking system for their own choices... *queue narrators obvious eye-roll*

Tonight's hot topic is a classic one, best movies of all time:

Kevin is a graduate from film school, and although he still works in the hospitality industry more often than in the film industry lately (thank-you strikes),
he thoroughly believes his life-long passion and exposure to films of kinds from all walks of life means he is best suited amongst the rest in determining 
the best movie of all time...

Naturally, everyone else agrees that Kevin, although 'educated' in the field, does not have the 'laypersons' understanding or interpretations of that world at heart,
and thus, neglects to account for a number of - what they deem - are some of the best movies of all time.

Jonnathan is the newest 'member' of the group so to speak, he is also the quietest/most reserved when it comes to these kinds of discussions as he feels he gets more entertainment
out of watching these long-time friends divoluge into commical finger pointing and acqusations and obviously, the yelling... 
*camera pans to Jonnathans face, zooms in slowly as his gaze meets the camera... a subtle, devilish smirk appears*


### HOWEVER! Tonight is different! TONIGHT is the night this classic discussion will finally have a ... FINAL DECISION ... *dun dun dun* 
### HOW?! Glad you asked fictitious reader/viewer...


Jonnathan has been secretly working behind the scenes... when others have been sleeping and returning to normal life after such catch-ups, Jonnathan has been tinkering, testing, building, devising
and programming... As the only Web Development graduate amongst this group of ~~chaos~~ friends, Jonnathan has created the ultimate *(in his eyes)* application to get a FINAL DECISION once and for all...
on any given topic of choice that is... *(he's considerate and inclusive like that our Jonnathan)*
